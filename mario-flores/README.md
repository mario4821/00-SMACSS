##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I referred to the SMCASS reference documentation : https://smacss.com/

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I tried reconfiguring the order of some of the CSS elements because the hero image got bigger and out of place.
